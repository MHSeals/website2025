The seals recently competed in the 2024 Roboboat competition. The competition was held in the Sarasota, Florida
and the seals were able to quickly pass safety inspection and get on the water. The seals were able to quickly
qualify on 4 out of 8 tasks, which got us to finals. In the finals, we were able to complete task 1. Detailed
results have not been released by Robonation yet, but we are excited to see how we did.

The seals were also able to win the Roboboat banner for the best team spirit. We were able to win the banner by
remaining active on our instagram and helping other teams with their boats.
