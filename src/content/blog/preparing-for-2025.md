### Gearing Up for the 2025 RoboBoat Competition!

Hey everyone! We’re the MHS Seals, the **only solo high school team** competing in the **2025 RoboBoat competition**, and we couldn’t be more excited to represent James Martin High School on this international stage! This competition brings together robotics, engineering, and computer science, and we’re here to show the world what high school students can do.

### Building an Autonomous Boat

Creating an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) is no small task—it’s a team effort with four key departments:

- **Engineering** builds the boat itself.
- **Computer Science** programs the boat to think and act autonomously.
- **Electrical Engineering** ensures the boat has all the power it needs.
- **Marketing** spreads the word and works with sponsors to support our journey.

It’s a massive project, and every department is working hard to ensure our boat is ready to compete.

### Computer Science: The Heart of Autonomy

The Computer Science team has been focused on pushing our boat’s autonomous capabilities forward. Here’s a closer look at what we’ve been working on:

- **Python, ROS, and MavROS**: We’re mastering **ROS 2** to make our code run seamlessly on the boat, with **MavROS** enabling communication with the flight controller. Ubuntu 22.04 is our go-to OS for development, and learning Linux basics is a must.
- **Computer Vision**: We’re training object detection models using tools like YOLOv11 and Roboflow to help the boat recognize buoys and other critical objects in the water.
- **LiDAR**: We’re improving the boat’s spatial awareness by integrating LiDAR, using it to map surroundings and calculate position.
- **Simulation**: We’re testing everything in simulation before hitting the water. Our Docker image includes all the tools needed, ensuring our code is portable and ready for testing.

We rely on **GitHub** for version control, enabling teamwork and code sharing. Continuous improvement is key, and we’re always refining, debugging, and testing. If you’re just starting out, remember—asking questions and learning from mistakes is the best way to grow!

### Engineering: Building the Backbone

The Engineering team is laser-focused on creating a strong, efficient, and reliable boat. This year, we’re sticking with fiberglass for the hull. The process involves building a sturdy frame, applying fiberglass, and finishing with Bondo for a smooth surface.

The boat’s internal structure uses aluminum extrusions, which allow us to easily adjust the placement of electronics and mechanisms. This modular design also helps balance the boat’s weight for optimal performance.

### About RoboBoat

The RoboBoat competition challenges teams to design, build, and program an autonomous boat capable of completing various tasks. This year’s theme, **“Guardians of the Waters,”** emphasizes environmental monitoring.

Key challenges include:

- Navigating through gates in the **Navigation Channel**.
- Following paths and docking autonomously.
- Completing speed challenges.
- Delivering objects as part of an **object-delivery task**.

In addition to on-water tasks, teams must submit a technical design report, create a website, and produce a team video. Deliverables like strategy presentations and system assessments will also be reviewed by the judges during the competition.

### The Road to Florida

The competition will take place in **Sarasota, Florida, in March**, with around 30 teams from all over the world. We’re preparing to meet tight deadlines, including submissions for event entries, design documentation, and shipping plans. There’s also a hotel booking deadline, and the team is managing everything to stay on track.

This journey has taught us the importance of **time management, communication, and collaboration**. We’re committed to making this year’s competition our best one yet.

Follow our progress on Instagram and GitHub, and feel free to reach out if you want to learn more about our team or join the fun. Let’s make this year unforgettable!
