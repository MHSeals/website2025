The Seals had an amazing time at the 2024 RoboBoat competition in sunny Sarasota, Florida! After a quick safety check, we jumped into the water and tackled the challenges with our best teamwork skills.

We were able to qualify for the finals in four out of eight tasks, which is a real accomplishment! This showed how well we worked together and how adaptable our boat was. We ended up placing a very respectable 9th place out of 15 teams in the finals, and our best round scored 440.74! (check out the full results [here](https://roboboat.org/2024/scores)).

But RoboBoat wasn't just about winning. We also had a lot of fun and made some new friends along the way. We were awarded a Roboboat banner for our enthusiasm and teamwork, which we were really proud of. We also made sure to be helpful to other teams and spread some cheer on social media.

Overall, we had an incredible experience at Roboboat 2024. We learned a lot, made some new friends, and had a blast doing it. We can't wait to compete again next year and see what challenges RoboBoat 2025 has in store for us!
