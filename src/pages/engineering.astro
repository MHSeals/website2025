    <p>
      Our Engineering Department is responsible for designing, building, and refining the physical structure of our autonomous boat, turning ideas into hardware that performs in real water and in competition.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What We Do</h2>

    <h3>Hull & Frame Design</h3>
    <p>
      We create and optimize the boat's hull and supporting structure, focusing on stability, strength, and efficient movement through water.
    </p>
    
    <h3>CAD & Prototyping</h3>
    <p>
      Using industry-standard CAD tools, we model our designs before building prototypes with tools like CNC machines, 3D printers, and laser cutters.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Fabrication & Assembly</h3>
    <p>
      Our team builds major components such as the hull, mounting systems, and payload structures. Every part is crafted to meet performance goals and competition rules.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Testing & Iteration</h3>
    <p>
      We test parts and full assemblies to ensure durability and functionality. Whether in pool trials or dry runs, we collect data, improve designs, and solve problems through hands-on engineering.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Collaboration</h2>
    <p>
      Engineering works closely with Computer Science and Electrical Engineering:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Our structure must support sensors, cameras, and wiring.</li>
      <li>We work with CS to mount and protect the computing hardware that enables autonomy.</li>
      <li>We coordinate with Electrical to integrate power distribution and signal lines.</li>
    </ul>
  </main>
