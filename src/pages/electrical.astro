		<p>
			Our electrical engineering department is responsible for everything electronic on the boat: power distribution, regulation, wiring, and the hardware that brings every subsystem together.
		</p>

		<h2>What We Do</h2>

		<h3>System Integration</h3>
		<p>
			This year, we developed a new frame in Fusion 360 to house all our electronics and ensure that every component has a stable place to sit. This infrastructure acts as the spine for the entire system, keeping everything secure no matter what.
		</p>

		<h3>Power Management</h3>
		<p>
			Our focus included designing new power management systems that regulate voltage from our battery cells to expand their usable lifespan. We also built hot-swapping systems that let us change batteries without shutting down the main computer.
		</p>

		<h3>Schematics & PCB Design</h3>
		<p>
			We use KiCad to create custom schematics and PCBs, making sure we meet the requirements of every subsystem on board while limiting failures across the boat.
		</p>

		<h3>Build, Wiring, and Testing</h3>
		<p>
			Once schematics and CAD are complete, we move into hands-on work: soldering, assembling, and crimping final wiring onto our bus bars. We test every connection rigorously so the boat can handle real-world environments.
