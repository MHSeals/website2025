		<p>
			Our electrical engineering department is responsible for the
			everything electronic with the boat like the power distribution and
			the physical hardware that brings everything together. This year, we
			developed a new frame in Fusion 360 to house all our electronics
			which ensure that every component has a stable place to sit. This
			infrastructure acts as the spine for the entire system, making sure
			everything stays stable no matter what.
		</p>
		<p>
			We also use a good bit of KiCad to design custom schematics and
			PCBs. This year, our focus included designing new Power Management
			Systems that allow us to regulate voltage from our battery cells to
			expand their usable lifespan. We also designed custom hot-swapping
			systems that allow our team to change batteries without having to
			shut down the main computer. This design process ensures that we
			meet the requirements of every subsystem on board and limit failures
			across the boat.
		</p>
		<p>
			The electrical workflow is a 50-50 split between digital design and
			physical implementation. Once schematics and CADs are complete, we
			move on into hands-on work. This includes soldering components onto
			PCBs, gluing parts together, and crimping the final wires onto our
			bus bars. We personally test every connection rigorously to make
			sure the boat can handle any environment, which helps us align with
			Roboboat's goal of designing boats to handle real-world challenges.
