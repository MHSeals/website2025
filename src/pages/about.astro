		</h1>

		<h3>From Dream to Reality</h3>
		<p>
			In 2018, a handful of ambitious students with a shared passion for
			robotics and engineering gathered around a simple idea: "What if we
			could build a boat that thinks for itself?" After discovering the
			prestigious RobotX competition, they were captivated by the
			challengeâ€”and yes, perhaps also by the prospect of competing in
			Hawaii. Recognizing the steep learning curve, these pioneers
			strategically chose to begin with the Roboboat competition as their
			entry point into the world of autonomous marine robotics.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since that moment, we have competed in the Roboboat competition 3
			times, improving our boat more and more with each iteration. What
			began as a rudimentary prototype has evolved into an increasingly
			sophisticated autonomous vessel, with each competition providing
			invaluable lessons and opportunities for growth. Our team has
			expanded from those initial founding members to a diverse group of
			over 60 students, all contributing their unique talents to our
			shared mission of pushing the boundaries of marine autonomy.

		<h3>Our Structure: Many Minds, One Mission</h3>
		<p>
			The MHS Seals operates like a well-oiled machine, with four
			specialized departments working in synchronized harmony. Each
			department brings unique skills to the table, and it's this
			interdisciplinary approach that has become our greatest strength.
		</p>

		<h4>Computer Science Team: The Brain</h4>
		<p>
			Our Computer Science department brings our vessel to life with
			sophisticated algorithms that enable it to "see," "think," and
			"decide." From intricate object detection systems that can identify
			buoys in variable lighting conditions to navigation algorithms that
			plot optimal courses through obstacle-filled waters, this team
			transforms our boat from a simple vessel into an intelligent marine
			system.

		<h4>Engineering Team: The Body</h4>
		<p>
			The Engineering department crafts the physical embodiment of our
			ideas. These innovative designers and builders tackle challenges
			from hydrodynamics to structural integrity, creating vessels that
			are both robust and agile. Their iterative prototyping process has
			led to breakthrough designs that have significantly improved our
			competition performance year after year.

		<h4>Electrical Engineering Team: The Nervous System</h4>
		<p>
			The Electrical Engineering department is the nervous system of our
			boat, ensuring that all components communicate effectively and
			reliably. From power distribution to sensor integration, this team
			ensures that our vessel's electrical systems are not only functional
			but also optimized for performance. Their expertise in circuit
			design and electrical theory is critical to the success of our
			autonomous marine systems.

		<h4>Marketing Team: The Voice</h4>
		<p>
			Our Marketing department is the public face of the MHS Seals,
			responsible for sharing our story with the world. From managing
			social media channels to securing sponsorships, this team ensures
			that our message reaches far and wide. Their efforts have not only
			raised awareness of our team but also secured critical funding that
			has enabled us to compete at the highest levels.
