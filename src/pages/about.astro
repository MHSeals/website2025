				<h3>From Dream to Reality</h3>
				<p>
					In 2018, a handful of ambitious students with a shared passion for
					robotics and engineering gathered around a simple idea: "What if we
					could build a boat that thinks for itself?" After discovering the
					prestigious RobotX competition, they were captivated by the
					challenge—and yes, perhaps also by the prospect of competing in
					Hawaii. Recognizing the steep learning curve, these pioneers
					strategically chose to begin with the Roboboat competition as their
					entry point into the world of autonomous marine robotics.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since that moment, we have competed in the Roboboat competition 4
					times, improving our boat more and more with each iteration. What
					began as a rudimentary prototype has evolved into an increasingly
					sophisticated autonomous vessel, with each competition providing
					invaluable lessons and opportunities for growth. Our team has
					expanded from those initial founding members to a diverse group of
					over 60 students, all contributing their unique talents to our
					shared mission of pushing the boundaries of marine autonomy.

		<p class="section-intro">
			The MHS Seals operate like a well-oiled machine, with four
			specialized departments working in synchronized harmony. Each
			department brings unique skills to the table, and it is this
			interdisciplinary approach that has become our greatest strength.

				<h3><a href="/cs">Computer Science Team</a></h3>
				<p>
					Our Computer Science department brings our vessel to life with
					sophisticated algorithms that enable it to "see," "think," and
					"decide." From intricate object detection systems that can identify
					buoys in variable lighting conditions to navigation algorithms that
					plot optimal courses through obstacle-filled waters, this team
					transforms our boat from a simple vessel into an intelligent marine
					system.

				<h3><a href="/engineering">Engineering Team</a></h3>
				<p>
					The Engineering department crafts the physical embodiment of our
					ideas. These innovative designers and builders tackle challenges
					from hydrodynamics to structural integrity, creating vessels that
					are both robust and agile. Their iterative prototyping process has
					led to breakthrough designs that have significantly improved our
					competition performance year after year.

				<p>
					The Electrical Engineering department is the nervous system of our
					boat, ensuring that all components communicate effectively and
					reliably. From power distribution to sensor integration, this team
					ensures that our vessel's electrical systems are not only functional
					but also optimized for performance. Their expertise in circuit
					design and electrical theory is critical to the success of our
					autonomous marine systems.
