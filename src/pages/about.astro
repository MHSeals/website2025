		<h2>From Dream to Reality</h2>
		<p>
			In 2018, a handful of ambitious students with a shared passion for robotics and engineering 
			gathered around a simple idea: "What if we could build a boat that thinks for itself?" 
			After discovering the prestigious RobotX competition, they were captivated by the challengeâ€”and 
			yes, perhaps also by the prospect of competing in Hawaii. Recognizing the steep learning curve, 
			these pioneers strategically chose to begin with the Roboboat competition as their entry point 
			into the world of autonomous marine robotics.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since that moment, we have competed in the Roboboat competition 3 times, improving our boat more and more with each iteration. 
			What began as a rudimentary prototype has evolved into an increasingly sophisticated autonomous vessel, 
			with each competition providing invaluable lessons and opportunities for growth. Our team has expanded from 
			those initial founding members to a diverse group of over 60 students, all contributing their unique talents 
			to our shared mission of pushing the boundaries of marine autonomy.

		<h2>Our Structure: Many Minds, One Mission</h2>
		<p>
			The MHS Seals operates like a well-oiled machine, with four specialized departments working in 
			synchronized harmony. Each department brings unique skills to the table, and it's this interdisciplinary 
			approach that has become our greatest strength.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Computer Science Team: The Brain</h3>
		<p>
			Our Computer Science department brings our vessel to life with sophisticated algorithms that enable it 
			to "see," "think," and "decide." From intricate object detection systems that can identify buoys in 
			variable lighting conditions to navigation algorithms that plot optimal courses through obstacle-filled 
			waters, this team transforms our boat from a simple vessel into an intelligent marine system.

		<h3>Engineering Team: The Body</h3>
		<p>
			The Engineering department crafts the physical embodiment of our ideas. These innovative designers and 
			builders tackle challenges from hydrodynamics to structural integrity, creating vessels that are 
			both robust and agile. Their iterative prototyping process has led to breakthrough designs that have 
			significantly improved our competition performance year after year.
